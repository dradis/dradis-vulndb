VulndbImport
============

This plugin can be used to connect the Dradis Framework to a remote vulnerability
database such as Security Root's Vuln::DB (http://securityroots.com/vulndb/). The 
idea is to have a database with commonly used notes that you can import to your 
current project. 

The current version of the plugin uses ActiveResource to access Vuln::DB's REST API.

You can also use the Thor task to search Vuln::DB from the command line:

$ thor dradis:import:vulndb:search XSS
